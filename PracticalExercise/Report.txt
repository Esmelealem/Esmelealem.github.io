For the report assignment, I tried to comment on each exercise files and  have learnt a lot form each of the follwoing.
1. When we extend a class, we don't define the attributes that are found in the super class.
2. We can reuse the variables and methods from the super class.
3. we have to use super method method under contructor to define each variable of the super class.
4. In the clock class, the solution on the site(Book) is not working and I have solved this issue using different logic.
